    <h1>Here's a Love Letter for you My Love 💌</h1>

    <p>
        This is just to tell you that you're my first thought in the morning and last thought at night. Whenever I wake up, all I think is about you. You're my ideal type, I had never thought that YOU would be my girlfriend literally YOU. You're the best literally the best person I've ever met, not gonna lie, on the times when I didn't wanted a future for myself you made me wanna have one. I want my future with YOU, Only YOU. I can't see myself with any other girl. I have eyes Only for you, ONLY YOU. Whenever you feel sad, I just want to hug you, to tell you that I'm here with you, You're not alone. Even though, today, I'm not with you. But I promise when we'd live together, You won't have to carry it all alone
    </p>

    <p>
        Sometimes I might be annoying and irritating I'm really sorry for that, That is really not my intention. My intentions are to make you the happiest person on the Earth, To make you feel like the world's most beautiful girl, Though You are but you don't believe me and trust me if I had a chance, I would just admire you for hours like 24/7, My eyes will never be tired of looking you. You literally bless my eyes. I really yearn you, You're my secret wish I ask from god, And, I would say that again IF I HAD A CHANCE I WOULD DEVOTE MYSELF TO YOU, I remember the day you sent me that reel and I remember my response. It was not just a response, it was a commitment, a promise, That's never gonna break.
    </p>

    <p>
        I know right now, there's soo much distance between us, but one day there would be like 0 distance we'll be like SOOOO close to each other. I would do my best to make our relationship workout and before future, I would take care of our present. I want to grow up with you, love you and take care of you forever. You'll forever be loved by me, Even on the times when we both doesn't understand each other, Even on the times when we get into an argument, even & specially on your lowest, You'll have me forever by your side. Until I die you'd have someone who loves you soo much. I have soo many life and relationship goals for us. I can't wait to grow up with you, Not gonna lie, sometimes I feel like we're made for each other like literally Made for each other. Our destiny wanted US to be together. Doesn't matter what happens in the end you have me, I have you and It's the best thing. In the end I just wanna say that jinke ghar shishe ke hote hai voh basement mein kapde badalte hai 😼
